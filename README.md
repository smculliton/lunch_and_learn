## Get Recipes For a Particular Country
* Testing should look for more than just the presence of attribute fields in the response. Testing should also determine which fields should NOT be present. (donâ€™t send back unnecessary data in the response)

## Register User
* make sure API key for users is unique

## Add Favorites
* test edge case if other params are missing

## General Info
README for Lunch and Learn app backend. Exposes endpoints to provide recipes, learning resources, and user data for front end consumption.

## Learning Goals
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc)

## Database Design

Pending

## Technologies
- Ruby 2.7.4
- Rails 5.2.8
